# NovaDatabases

This project was designed, implemented, and tested by Cassia Trusty. The following are instructions on how to execute the database files.

Download the sql files named 'CassiaTFinalProjectData' and 'CassiaTFinalProjectSchema'. The latter file holds all of the commands for creating the database's tables, the former file holds all inserting data into the tables. The 'CassiaTFinalProjectSchema' file must be run before the 'CassiaTFinalProjectData' file is run so that there are tables to fill.
